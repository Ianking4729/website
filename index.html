            My name is Ian Kingori, and I’m a 19-year-old student at North Carolina A&T State University. While I’ve spent most of my life in Charlotte, North Carolina, my roots trace back to Kenya, a beautiful country in East Africa. I’m passionate about video editing and graphic design, hobbies that allow me to express my creativity and attention to detail. A fun fact about me is that I pride myself on being both highly creative and open-minded, always eager to explore new ideas and perspectives.</p>
